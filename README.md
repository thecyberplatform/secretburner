# Secret Burner

Secure, single-use secrets that vanish after viewing.

You can use secret burner free @ https://secretburner.com/

There is currently a limit of 20 requests per endpoint per hour. Once I hit my funding target of
AU$2,100, I will be able to remove these limits.

You can help me fund this service until October, 2025 by contributing here:

# Technical Details

Secret Burner has been built on a core stack of open source technologies:

```
- API : Django (https://djangoproject.com)
- UI  : Quasar (https://quasar.dev)
- DB  : PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org)
```

## Principles

The project is structured such that functionality is largely contained.

# Makefile

This project has a customised Makefile to provide shortcuts to otherwise long commands.

To get acquainted with all the available commands, simply run `make help`.

# Local development

Local builds of this application have only been tested on MacOS 14+.

Feel free to test on other operating systems and submit a pull request to add functionality where it
is lacking.

## Preparing for local build

In each "app", you will need to rename the .example.env file to .env

Change any settings that you want, or leave them blank if they are marked as optional.

All environment variables are described. You should never need to modify configuration/setting files inside
the apps - all default user controllable features can be managed from .env files.

### Install docker

You will need to install docker. Google search this if you don't know how to do it.

## Running locally

To run secret burner, navigate back to the root of this project, and using the terminal run:

```bash
make up
```

This will build all the services needed to run the whole application. Just like magic.

Once it's done, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost and start creating secrets!

# Production deployment

TBC - This is still work in progress.
