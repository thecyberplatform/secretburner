## Code of Conduct

### Our Principles
**Do it right**

Nothing is done without thought and consideration. Cutting corners is the best way to fuck things up. 

- Strive for quality in your contributions. 
- Communicate clearly, collaborate effectively, and provide thoughtful feedback. 
- Always act in the best interest of the community and project.

**Do the right thing**

Arguably more important than doing things right, is doing the right thing. We believe everyone's 
mission in life should be putting more good into the world than they take. Net positive impact.

Everything we do, we make sure it's the right thing. From our professional conduct guides, to our baked
in desire to make the world a better place - doing the right should form part of your DNA.

**Don't be a dickhead**

This is a carve out from "Do the right thing". Sometimes we say things that will offend someone else. There is nothing
wrong with that; and I encourage everyone to have an opinion when their INTENT is not malicious. 

If you intend to be offensive, you are being a dickhead; and it will not be tolerated.

### Consequences
Violations of this Code may result in corrective actions, including warnings or removal from the project.

All participants are expected to uphold these standards in all interactions.
